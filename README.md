# Mock Remake

Redesign a dribble design, try to reference the [BEM](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/) method.

## Expectations
- header top, you can choose whether that is sticky or not. Feel free to steal code off of code pen.
- keep everything in a row for the different sections
- use google fonts
- for the grid in the ‘ship proficiently’ section, use the ‘padding’ method? 
- the main graphic, it can just be one picture

## Todo 
- see how the picture, aspect ratio thing is done
- look into [responsiveness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9fZZpcfdXg&list=WL&index=57&t=413s)
- look into the shapes/patterns
